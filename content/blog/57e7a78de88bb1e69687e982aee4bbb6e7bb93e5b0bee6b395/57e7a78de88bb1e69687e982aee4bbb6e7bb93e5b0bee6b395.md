**Best**  
This is the most ubiquitous; it’s totally safe. I recommend it highly and so do the experts.  
 最普遍；最安全。我和专家们都极力推荐这个。

**My Best**  
 A little stilted. Etiquette consultant Lett likes it.  
 有点生硬。礼仪顾问莱特喜欢这个。

**My best to you**  
 Lett also likes this one. I think it’s old-fashioned.  
 莱特也喜欢这个。我认为它过时了。

 All Best  
 Harmless.  
 可以用。  
 All the best  
 This works too.  
 这个也可以。  
 Best Wishes  
 Seems too much like a greeting card but it’s not bad.  
 看起来特别像贺卡，但是还不赖。  
 Bests  
 I know people who like this but I find it fussy. Why do you need the extra “s”?  
 我知道有人喜欢，但是我觉得它很繁琐。为什么你需要多余的“s”？  
 Best Regards  
 More formal than the ubiquitous “Best”. I use this when I want a note of formality.  
 比最普遍的“Best”更正式。当我想要正式的写结尾时我会用这个。  
 Regards  
 Fine, anodyne, helpfully brief. I use this.  
 不错，稳重，简短。我用这个。  
 Rgds  
 I used to use this but stopped, because it’s trying too hard to be abbreviated. Why not type three more letters? OK if you’re sending it from your phone.  
 我过去常用这个但是现在没用了，缩写太过了点。为什么不多写几个字母？如果是用手机发邮件的话，这个OK 。  
 Warm Regards  
 I like this for a personal email to someone you don’t know very well, or a business email that is meant as a thank-you.  
 我喜欢在给不是很了解的人发私人邮件时用这个，或在商业邮件里表达谢意。  
 Warmest Regards  
 As good as Warm Regards, with a touch of added heat.  
 跟Warm Regards一样好，且更增添了一丝温暖。  
 Warmest  
 I use this often for personal emails, especially if I’m close to someone but not in regular touch.  
 私人邮件中我常常用这个，尤其是当我跟某人比较熟但又不常联系时。  
 Warmly  
 This is a nice riff on the “warm” theme that can safely be used among colleagues.  
 这是一个关于 “warm” 主题很好的结尾，在同事之间使用很安全。  
 Take care  
 In the right instances, especially for personal emails, this works.  
 在适合的情况下，尤其是私人邮件，这个很有用。  
 Thanks  
 Lett says this is a no-no. “This is not a closing. It’s a thank-you,” she insists. I disagree. Forbes Leadership editor Fred Allen uses it regularly and I think it’s an appropriate, warm thing to say. I use it too.  
 莱特说这个禁用。她认为“这不是结尾而是感谢。”我不同意。福布斯领导力编辑弗莱德·艾伦经常用这个，我认为它是一个合适的、暖心的词。我也用。  
 Thanks so much  
 I also like this and use it, especially when someone—a colleague, a source, someone with whom I have a business relationship—has put time and effort into a task or email.  
 我也喜欢而且会用这个，尤其是当某人——同事、人脉资源、跟我有业务关系的人——花时间和精力完成任务和邮件时，我会用这个。  
 Thanks!  
 This rubs me the wrong way because I used to have a boss who ended every email this way. She was usually asking me to perform a task and it made her sign-off seem more like a stern order, with a forced note of appreciation, than a genuine expression of gratitude. But in the right context, it can be fine.  
 这个很让我恼火，因为我曾经有个老板每封邮件都用这个结尾。他经常让我完成一个任务，带着勉强感谢的符号，这让他的结尾看起来像是一个严厉的命令，而不是真诚地致谢。但是在合适的语境中，它也适用。  
 Thank you  
 More formal than “Thanks.” I use this sometimes.  
 比“Thanks”更正式。我有时用这个。  
 Thank you!  
 This doesn’t have the same grating quality as “Thanks!” The added “you” softens it.  
 这个不会像“Thanks”那么让人不悦！“You” 缓和了语气。  
 Many thanks  
 I use this a lot, when I genuinely appreciate the effort the recipient has undertaken.  
 当我由衷感谢收件人所付出的努力时，我常常用这个。  
 Thanks for your consideration.  
 A tad stilted with a note of servility, this can work in the business context, though it’s almost asking for a rejection. Steer clear of this when writing a note related to seeking employment.  
 有点生硬带点屈从，尽管它几乎是寻求排斥，但是在商业邮件中它很有用。当你写就业相关的邮件时，避免使用它。  
 Thx  
 I predict this will gain in popularity as our emails become more like texts.  
 随着我们的邮件变得更像文本，我猜想这个会越来越受欢迎。  
 Hope this helps  
 I like this in an email where you are trying to help the recipient.  
 在试图帮助收件人的邮件中我喜欢这个。  
 Looking forward  
 I use this too. I think it’s gracious and warm, and shows you are eager to meet with the recipient.  
 我也用这个。我认为它很亲切、暖心，并且显得你很渴望见到收件人。  
 Rushing  
 This works when you really are rushing. It expresses humility and regard for the recipient.  
 当你赶时间时这个很有用。它表达了你的谦卑和对收件人的尊重。  
 In haste  
 Also good when you don’t have time to proofread.  
 当你没有时间校对时用这个也蛮好。  
 Be well  
 Some people find this grating. Not appropriate for a business email.  
 有些人认为不太好听，在商业邮件中不合适。  
 Peace  
 Retro, this sign-off wears its politics on its sleeve. It doesn’t bother me but others might recoil.  
 很复古，这个结尾具有政治色彩。有人可能不太适应，但我OK。  
 Yours Truly  
 I don’t like this. It makes me feel like I’m ten years old and getting a note from a pen pal in Sweden.  
 我不喜欢这个。它让我有种我十岁从瑞典笔友那里收到一封信的感觉。  
 Yours  
 Same problem as above.  
 和上面那个问题一样。  
 Very Truly Yours  
 Lett likes this for business emails but I find it stilted and it has the pen pal problem.  
 莱特喜欢在商业邮件中用这个，但我认为不自然，还是像笔友信件。  
 Sincerely  
 Lett also likes this but to me, it signals that the writer is stuck in the past. Maybe OK for some formal business correspondence, like from the lawyer handling your dead mother’s estate.  
 莱特也喜欢这个，但是对于我来说，这表明作者停留在过去。也许对于某些正式的商业通信是OK的，例如来自处理你去世母亲遗产的律师信函。  
 Sincerely Yours  
 Same problem as “Sincerely,” but hokier.  
 跟“Sincerely”问题一样，但是有些做作。  
 Cheers!  
 I wonder how prevalent this is in the UK. I’ve only seen it from Americans who are trying for a British affectation. I know it shouldn’t grate on me but it does. I also don’t like people telling me to cheer up.  
 我好奇这个在英国怎么这么流行。我只在试图模仿英国人的美国人的邮件中看到过这个。我知道这个不该激怒我，但是它确实会。我也不喜欢别人告诉我cheer up。  
 Ciao （意大利语的“你好；再见”）  
 Pretentious for an English-speaker, though I can see using it in a personal, playful email.  
 母语是英语的人用这个词显得很装，虽然在一些玩笑化的个人邮件中使用它我能理解。  
 Your name  
 Terse but just fine in many circumstances. Probably not a good idea for an initial email.  
 虽然简洁，但是在很多情况下都适用。可能用在最开始的邮件中用不是很好。  
 Initial  
 Good if you know the recipient and even fine in a business context if it’s someone with whom you correspond frequently.  
 如果你认识收件人，这样用很好；如果你经常和他通信，那么这个在商业邮件中也很适用。  
 Love  
 This seems too informal, like over-sharing in the business context.  
 这个看起来太不正式，在商业邮件中就像过度分享。  
 XOXO  
 I’ve heard of this being used in business emails but I don’t think it’s a good id ea.  
 我听说过在商业邮件中使用这个，但是我认为这不是个好主意。  
 Lots of love  
 I would only use this in a personal email. The “lots of” makes it even more inappropriately effusive tha n the simple, clean “Love.”  
 我只会在私人邮件中使用这个。“Lots of”比简洁的“Love”更显得过度热情。  
 Hugs  
 It’s hard to imagine this in a business email but it’s great when you’re writing to your granny.  
 很难想象在商务邮件中用这个，但是如果你是在跟你的奶奶写信，这个就非常好。  
 Smiley face  
 Emoticons are increasingly accepted, though some people find them grating. I wouldn’t sign off this way unless I were writing to my kid.  
 尽管有些人为之恼火，但是表情符号越来越被广为接受。但除非我跟我的孩子写信，否则我不会用这个结尾。  
 😉  
 I’ve gotten emails from colleagues with these symbols and I find they brighten my day.  
 我收到过同事发的邮件中使用这个符号，我觉得它们很阳光。  
 \[:-)  
 I’m a sucker for variations on the smiley face made with punctuation marks, though I suspect most people don’t like them.  
 尽管我怀疑大多数人都不喜欢，但是我看到用标点符号构成的笑脸还挺高兴的。  
 High five from down low  
 A colleague shared this awful sign-off which is regularly used by a publicist who handles tech clients. An attempt to sound cool, which fails.  
 一个同事分享了这个糟糕的结尾，这个结尾被处理技术客户的公关频繁使用。这个尝试听起来很酷，但是未能凑效。  
 Take it easy bro  
 Though it might turn some people off, I would be fine receiving an email with this sign-off, knowing the sender lives in an informal milieu.  
 尽管它可能使一些人反感，但是我收到用它结尾的邮件时感觉挺好，因为我知道这个发件人在非正式的环境下生活。  
 See you around  
 Lett would cringe but this seems fine to me.  
 莱特可能不喜欢，但是对我来说似乎挺好。  
 Have a wonderful bountiful lustful day  
 It’s weird and off-putting.  
 这种表达很奇怪而且会令人不快。  
 Sent from my iPhone  
 This may be the most ubiquitous sign-off. It used to bother me but I realize that it explains brevity and typos.  
 这可能是你常常看到的结尾。以前这个签名总是困扰我，但后来我明白了它只是为了解释信件简洁和出现错别字的原因。  
 Typos courtesy of my iPhone  
 Slightly clever but it’s gotten old. Better to use the automated message.  
 稍显聪明，但很老旧了。用自动消息会更好。  
 Sent from a prehistoric stone tablet  
 I laughed the first time I read it but then the joke wore thin.  
 当我第一次读到时，我笑了，但是过后这个笑话就不好笑了。  
 Pardon my monkey thumbs  
 Same problem here.  
 跟上面的问题一样。  
 Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail.  
 A preachy relic of the past. Who doesn’t know that printing uses paper?  
 证明发件人过去爱说教。谁不知道用纸打印对环境的影响？  
 vCards  
 I think these are a great idea. At least they work well on my Dell desktop when I want to load a contact into Outlook.  
 我认为这个是个好主意。当我想要加载一个联系方式到Outlook上时，至少这个在我的戴尔桌面上很好用。
